.SH NAME
thermald \- start Linux thermal daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B thermald
.RI " [ " OPTIONS " ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B thermald
is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of platforms. This daemon monitors
temperature and applies compensation using available cooling methods.

By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU temperature under control, before HW takes aggressive correction action.

Thermal daemon looks for thermal sensors and thermal cooling drivers in the Linux thermal sysfs (/sys/class/thermal) and builds a
list of sensors and cooling drivers. Each of the thermal sensors can optionally be binded to a cooling drivers by the in kernel
drivers. In this case the Linux kernel thermal core can directly take actions based on the temperature trip points, for each sensor
and associated cooling device. For example a trip temperature X in a sensor can be associates a cooling driver Y. So when
the sensor temperature = X, the cooling driver "Y" is activated.

Thermal daemon allows to change this relationship or add new one via a thermal configuration file (thermal-conf.xml). This
file is automatically created and used, if the platform has ACPI thermal relationship table. If not this needs to be
manually configured.

When there is a sensor, which has no associate cooling device, via configuration file or thermal relationship table, then
this sensor is tested for relationship with CPU load dynamically up to maximum 3 times. If there is no relationship, then
it is added to a black list of unbinded sensors and not tried again.

Optionally thermal daemon can act as an exclusive thermal controller by using thermal sysfs and acting as a user space governor.
In this case kernel thermal core is not active and decision is taken by thermal daemon only.

Dbus Interface: When started with dbus-enable option, dbus interface can be used to control thermal temperature at which cooling action takes place. This change is persistent. For example, to start CPU cooling at 80C, dbus-send command can be used:

# dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.thermald /org/freedesktop/thermald org.freedesktop.thermald.SetUserPassiveTemperature string:cpu uint32:80000


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show help options.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print thermald version and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-no-daemon
Don't become a daemon: Default is daemon mode.
.TP
.B \-\-loglevel=info
log severity: info level and up.
.TP
.B \-\-loglevel=debug
log severity: debug level and up: Max logging.
.TP
.B \-\-poll-interval
Poll interval in seconds: Poll for zone temperature changes.
To disable polling, set to zero. Polling can only be disabled, if available temperature sensors can notify temperature change asynchronously.
.TP
.B \-\-dbus-enable
Enable Dbus.
.TP
.B \-\-exclusive-control
Act as exclusive thermal controller. This will use user-space
governor for thermal sysfs and take over control.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-cpuid-check
Ignore cpuid check for supported CPU models.
.TP
.B \-\-config-file
Specify thermal-conf.xml path and ignore default thermal-conf.xml.
