Compatibility with thermald
--------------------------------------------
This tool requires thermald version "1.4.3" or later.

Building the Thermal Monitor with Qt Creator
--------------------------------------------

The project uses Qt 5 for the graphical user interface portion of the thermal monitor.  A normal distribution of Qt includes Qt Creator, the IDE used for editing the forms and code.  Using Creator Qt is the easiest way to build the project.

Open Qt Creator, click File->Open File or Project, browse the project files to open ThermalMonitor.pro.  The project files are displayed on the left side under Headers, Sources, and Forms.  Build the project by clicking Build->Build Project (or Ctrl-b).  A solid green status bar in the lower right corner indicates a successful build.


Running the project
-------------------
To communicate with thermald via dbus, the user has to be member of a group able to manage power.
So make sure that there is a power related group the system and add your user id to this group.
On some systems this group will be called "power" and on others it may be called "powerdev".

Building the Thermal Monitor with make
--------------------------------------

Normally Qt Creator handles the compilation of the project.  If you wish to use the command line to compile, then you first have to create a makefile.  Qmake will create the makefile for you based on the project file.  Invoke with:

qmake ThermalMonitor.pro

After the makefile has been created, use 'make' to build the project.  The object files and executable will be in the same directory as the source code, a different location than when using Qt Creator.  Use 'make clean' to clean up everything except the executable.

Dependency on qcustomplot
To build you need to download qcustomplot-devel or libqcustomplot-dev depending on your distribution.
