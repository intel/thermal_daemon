Release 1.9.1
- Remove default CPU temperature compensation for auto generated configuration from dptfxtract
- Minor Android build warnings

Release 1.9
- The major change in this version is the active power limits adjustment.
This will be useful to improve performance on some newer platform. But
this will lead to increase in CPU and other temperatures. Hence this
is important to run dptfxtract version 1.4.1 tool to get performance
sensitive thermal limits (https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract/commits/v1.4.1).
If the default configuration picked up by thermald is not optimal, user
can select other less aggressive configuration. Refer to the README here
https://github.com/intel/dptfxtract/blob/master/README.txt

This power limit adjustment depends on some kernel changes released with
kernel version v5.3-rc1. For older kernel release run thermald with
--workaround-enabled
But this will depend on /dev/mem access, which means that platforms with
secure boot must update to newer kernels.

- TCC offset limits
As reported in some forums that some platforms have issue with high TCC
offset settings. Under some special condition this offset is adjusted,
but that currently needs msr module loaded to get MSR access
from user space. I have submitted a patch to have this exported via sysfs
for v5.4+ kernel.

- To disable all the above performance optimization, use --disable-active-power.
Since Linux Thermal Daemon implementation doesn't have capability to match
IntelÂ® Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (DPTF) implementation on other
Operating systems, this option is very important if the user is experiencing
thermal issues. If there is some OEM/manufactures have issue with this
implementation, please get back to me for blacklist of platforms.
